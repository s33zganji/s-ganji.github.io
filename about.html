        Hello there! Welcome to my homepage. <br>

    </br>
    I am Zahra Ganji, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Bonn. I was born in Tehran, Iran. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), which is recognized as the second-best engineering university in Iran. </br>
    During my Bachelor's degree, my areas of specialization were artificial intelligence and computer networks. In my current pursuit of a Master's degree, I am focusing on the Intelligent Systems branch of courses.</br>
    Currently, I am employed at the High-Performance Computing and Analytics Lab at the University of Bonn. In this role, I am responsible for enhancing and instructing the curriculum of the Foundations of Machine Learning and Deep Learning course in Python.</br>
Throughout my education, I have undertaken numerous projects, some of which are available on my GitHub page. I possess a strong enthusiasm for computer science, various methodologies of machine learning and deep learning. I have also gained research experience in these fields, including my research paper conducted in collaboration with the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry (RIPI). The paper explores the application of machine learning models for predicting gas hydrate formation conditions, and it has been published in the Iranian Journal
of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (IJCCE).
